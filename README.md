# Notes Matter
A simple note-taking app created for the Android platform.  
Created purely as a personal hobby with no prior experience in app development.

## Todo
- Add the ability to create separate lists
- Add the ability to add notes to existing items
- ~~Add the ability to authenticate users~~
- ~~Add the ability to sync with remote database in real time~~
- ~~Refactor adapters~~
- ~~Implement selection mode properly (sort of)~~ 
- ~~Limit task description to a certain length of character~~
- Rebuild using external library for better performance
- ~~Add the ability to set deadline for tasks~~
- ~~Implement dynamic layout to allow for:~~
  * ~~Tasks with or without deadline~~
  * ~~Tasks that span for more than a single line~~
- ~~Better support for pre-v21 (Kitkat) devices~~
- Better logo...?

## Usage
- Android 4.4 KitKat or higher
- Please uninstall the app and try reinstalling if it crashes on startup
